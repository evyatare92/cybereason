Hello. Here is my solution for the assignment  
  
The files 'docker-compose.yml' and 'init.js' are used to create the mongodb container and init the database (questions 1 and 2).  
The file '3 - Export Data from container to host.py' is the solution to question 3.  
The file '4 - Manipulating Exported Data.py' is the solution to question 4.  
The files '5 - Show New Data.py' and the 'data.html' in the 'templates' folder are the solution to question 5.
